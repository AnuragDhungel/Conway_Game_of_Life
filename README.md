# Conway_Game_of_Life
## This is a conway game of life simulation using correlation matrix (similar of CNN but without traing the weights). 
### The best way to solve a problem is to solve the problem. The second best way is to use a CNN.
### In this problem, as we can mathematically derive the solution, training under a data set is over kill.
### I have solve all the possible cases from one step to another and manually given the parameter values.(They are calculated by short function)
### You can direcly run the code Conway_Game_of_life.py
### If you want to edit it,
###if __name__ == '__main__':
###  row=5 (row in the game world matrix)
###  col=5  (column in the game world matrix)
###  number=1 (This is the base number. This number calculates different solution) (Feel Free to use any number)
###  time_difference_between_evolution=1
###  game=conway_game_of_life(row,col,number) (This creates a class)
###  game.play_game(time_difference_between_evolution)(You start the game with this.
